/**
 * Q+A
 *
 * In the code above:
 *
 * 1) Do all connected clients read from the shared object?
 *
 * Yes.
 *
 * 2) Do all connected clients write to the shared object?
 *
 * Yes. They all write to the shared.circles array of the shared object.
 *
 * 3) Is it possible that two clients will write to the shared object at one time?
 *
 * Yes. If they both click the screen at approximately the same time, they will both try to write to the shared object at the same time.
 *
 * 4) What would happen if two clients write to the shared object at one time?
 *
 * There will be a conflict in writing and only one of the clients' data will get written.
 *
 * Note: This does mean that his demo has a "bug" that appears when two players click at the same time.
 * There are ways to fix the bug, but it might not be necessary if its not a problem in practice.
 * p5.party is a prototyping library, after all.
 *
 * 5) Do all clients write to the shared.timer property?
 *
 * No. Only the host writes to shared.timer because it is enclosed in a check for partyIsHost().
 *
 * 6) Do all clients read the shared.timer property?
 *
 * Yes. Because they need to read it to display it on their own screen.
 *
 * 7) When a new client joins a room which already has a host, will the timer be reset?
 *
 * No. Because the host is the only one affecting the timer. The new client will just read the value of it as is.
 *
 * 8) When the host leaves the room, but other clients still remain, will the timer continue to decrease?
 *
 * Yes. Because the library will assign a new host who will take over running the host code.
