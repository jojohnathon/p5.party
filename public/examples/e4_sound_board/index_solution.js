/**
 * Q+A
 *
 * In the code above...
 *
 * 1) Does this example use any shared objects?
 *
 * No. It uses partyEmit() and partySubscribe() to communicate, but no state is stored or shared.
 *
 * 2) Do multiple clients write to the same shared object at the same time?
 *
 * No. There aren't any shared objects at all!
 *
 * 3) How does each client know _when_ to play a sound?
 *
 * Sounds are played when the `playSound` event is received.
 *
 * 4) How does each client knowh _which_ sound to play?
 *
 * The `playSound` event data is the name of the sound to play.
 *
 * 5) Is the sound data transmitted from client to client?
 *
 * No. Only the name of the sound is transmitted.
 *
 * 6) How does each client get the sound data?
 *
 * Each client preloads the sound data from a file in preload().
 *
 * 7) Do clients in other rooms or apps receive events from this client?
 *
 * No. Clients only receive events from other clients in the same app and room.
 *
 * 8) Are newly joined clients informed of past events?
 *
 * No. Unlike shared data, events are transient.
