/**
 * Q+A
 *
 * In the code above:
 *
 * 1) Is the object refrenced by `my` in the `guests` array?
 *
 * Yes.
 * The participant array has one shared object for each connected client
 * including the connected one.
 *
 * 2) Does more than one client write to the same shared object?
 *
 * No. Clients only write to their own shared object.
 *
 * 3) Does more than one client read from the same shared object?
 *
 * Yes. Every client reads from every object in `guests`.
 *
 * 4) Do all the clients have the same objects in their `guests` arrays?
 *
 * Yes. The `guests` array is kept in sync by p5.party.
 *
 * 5) Do all the clients have the same `my` object?
 *
 * No. `my` is created with partyLoadMyShared() which returns a different
 * shared object to each connected client.
 *
 * 6) Is it possible that `my.name` will have a value before setup() is called?
 *
 * No. `my` will be empty when setup() is called.
 *
 * 7) Is it possible that some of the objects in `guests` will have a
 *    `name` set before setup() is called?
 *
 * Yes. Yes other clients might set their name before this client connects.
 *
 * 8) How many shared objects will be in the `guests` array when setup()
 *    is called?
 *
 * At least 1: the shared object for this client. The total number will depend
 * on how many clients are connected.
