/**
 * Q+A
 *
 * In the code above:
 *
 * 1) Is the object refrenced by `my` in the `guests` array?
 *
 * 2) Does more than one client write to the same shared object?
 *
 * 3) Does more than one client read from the same shared object?
 *
 * 4) Do all the clients have the same objects in their `guests` arrays?
 *
 * 5) Do all the clients have the same `my` object?
 *
 * 6) Is it possible that `my.name` will have a value before setup() is called?
 *
 * 7) Is it possible that some of objects in `guests` will have a `name`
 *    set before setup() is called?
 *
 * 8) How many objects will be in the `guests` array when setup()
 *    is called?
